# Introduction
This project is based on a smart car that whenever it goes out of the lane
(a color different than the black is detected ), 
a warning message should be displayed on the screen 
(the message “ALERT ” is displayed on the FPGA board ).
In addition , The car also stops when it detects an obstacle in front of it (The motor stops rotating).

# Parts Used

• 2 sensors


• 1 5V motor


• MAX 10 FPGA on DE10-LITE


• Breadboard
